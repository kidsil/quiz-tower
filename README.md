JS Styleguide:

(some of the code is example code, but let's try to make it as close as possible to the styleguide)


# install
1. First step: 
`git submodule init && 
git submodule update`

2. Second step:
`npm install
grunt
`
3. Third step: run some local server (for example php miniserver) on the folder:
`sudo php -S localhost:8080
`
